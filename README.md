# DataAnalysis-Pandas
# Overview
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an HR dataset to understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition. The analysis was done using Python and Pandas, and various statistical and visualization techniques were used to derive actionable insights.
# Dataset

#  Key Objectives
Understand the distribution of employee attrition.

Identify which features correlate most with attrition.

Perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.

Handle missing values and outliers.

Draw conclusions and actionable insights for HR decision-making.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis
Attrition distribution (Yes vs No)

Department-wise employee count

Age, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction histograms

Education Field, Gender, Job Role, Marital Status frequency counts

Bivariate Analysis

Attrition vs Job Satisfaction

Attrition vs Age

Attrition vs Monthly Income

# Key Findings

Employees with low job satisfaction, low income, and longer distance from home are more likely to leave.
Younger employees (age < 30) have a higher attrition rate.
